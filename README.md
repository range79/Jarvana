## About Jarvana

**Jarvana** is a sleek and intuitive web-based control panel that allows you to upload, run, stop, and monitor Java `.jar` files without ever needing to touch the terminal. Whether you are on mobile, desktop, or a restricted environment, you can start and control your Java applications with just a click.

The backend is fully written in Kotlin using Spring Boot, while the frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.  
The frontend was expertly **designed and developed by Cursor**, focusing on a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

---

## Purpose

Jarvana was created to remove the need for command-line interaction when managing Java applications. It simplifies running `.jar` files and provides a centralized dashboard for execution control and real-time output monitoring.
